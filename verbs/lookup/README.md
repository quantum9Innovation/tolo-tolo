# Notes on lookup
## Supported Verbs
All verbs starting with 'መ-' or 'ማ-' that do not have a 'ተ' sound or begin with 'ማስ-' are supported.
## Germinated Consonants
To improve results, add a period (.) after Amharic letters (ለ.) or English transliterations for those letters (le.) to indicate consonants that are lengthened. For example, consider the change in the 'ለ' sound from አለ (he said) vs አለ. (there is). This practice is optional and in most cases the program will automatically detect which consonants are germinated.
## Typing in Amharic
Fully supported
## Typing in English
Consonant sounds are transliterated by their English equivalents (capital leters are used for emphasized consonants like ጠ, ጱ, etc.)
Vowel sounds are transliterated as shown below:
መ | ሙ | ሚ | ማ | ሜ | ም | ሞ
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
me | mu | mee | ma | may | mi | mo

All letters should be seperated by a dash like: \
me-fe-le-gi = መፈለግ
