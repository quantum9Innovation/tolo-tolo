# tolo-tolo | ቶሎ፡ቶሎ
A set of language tools for learning English→Amharic <br>
Most of these tools are pushed straight to [quantum9innovation.github.io/amharic](https://quantum9innovation.github.io/amharic)
<br><br>
## Note
**Without proper rendering support for the Ethiopic block of Unicode characters, many of the program outputs may not be visible. If you cannot see the Amharic for `tolo-tolo` at the top of this README, you need to install the Ethiopic characters before continuing.**
