## Why this name?
ቶሎ፡ቶሎ (pronounced tolo tolo - \o\ like that of home) means 'fast' (adv) in Amharic.
## Note
Without proper rendering support for the Ethiopic block of Unicode characters, many of the program outputs may not be visible. If you cannot see the Amharic for `tolo-tolo` at the top of this README, you need to install the Ethiopic characters before continuing.
